# Stop saving chunks bruh

## Description

In 1.18 mojang had the genius idea of saving 20 chunks every single tick to reduce the lag spike from autosave.
However, this backfired real fast and causes stupidly high amount of lag in normal gameplay and significantly increases disk usage.

The mod simply skips this saving 20 chunks so chunks are only saved on autosave.
